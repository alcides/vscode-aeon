## Uv
[Uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package manager and virtual environment tool designed to be a drop-in replacement for `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv`. It ensures that Python dependencies are resolved and installed quickly and reproducibly.

To install Uv on Windows, download the latest Windows executable from the [Uv Releases page](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases) and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.

If the installation command runs without displaying an error, **Uv** has been successfully installed. If it displays an error that you do not understand, check the [Uv GitHub repository's issues section](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues) or refer to the troubleshooting guidance in their documentation.
